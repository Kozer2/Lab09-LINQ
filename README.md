# Lab09-LINQ


# Objective
Create a program that brings in data from an external file, reads the data, and can filter the data based on specified values.

# Challenge  
### The Problem Domain  
Program Specifications
Your solution should include the following:

The data.json file to your solution root folder
Read in the file and answer the questions below
Each question and answer should be outputted to the console.
Questions
Each query builds off of the prior query. You should be chaining.

Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list (Final Total: 147 neighborhoods)
Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names (Final Total: 143)
Remove the duplicates (Final Total: 39 neighborhoods)
Rewrite the queries from above and consolidate all into one single query.
Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ Query statements instead of LINQ method calls and vice versa.)
You should have a total of 5 outputs.
